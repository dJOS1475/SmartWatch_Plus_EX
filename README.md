SmartWatch+ Tandy 1000 EX Edition

The Tandy 1000 EX SmartWatch+ module adds a Clock & Calendar to your 1000 EX. All you need to do is install it under the BIOS ROM and then use the Y2K Patched SMWCLOCK.COM utility to set the time automatically via your Autoexec.bat file.

I made this design because the original SmartWatch batteries are now mostly dead and can't be replaced. The 1000 SmartWatch+ uses a standard CR1632 Lithium coin cell for long life and easy replacement.
